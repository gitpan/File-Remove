Revision history for Perl extension File::Remove.

0.36 Fri 30 Jun 2007  (Adam Kennedy)
    - Avoid the installation of Mac::Glue.
      (It should not be necesary to test voice synthesis to delete a file)
    - Anyone truly needing "trash" support will need to add a dependency
      on Mac::Glue themself. The function may be split out of File::Remove
      later down the track.
    - Constanting the debugger flag for a minor speed and memory improvement
    - Copy in a known-readonly flag for more accurate testing on Win32
    - Remove assumption that -w implied deletion rights on Win32
    - Validate that the file was actually deleted.
    - Add better mode-handling for files.
    - Add smarter implementation of "candelete" logic.

0.35 Fri  9 Feb 2007  (Stephen Steneker)
    - Update makefile to require Mac::Glue version compatible with Intel macs
    - Change pod heading from "methods" to "subroutines" [RT#13687]
    - No functional changes from 0.34

0.34 Mon Nov 6 2006
    - Update t/03 to skip the "is this file not writable" test when
      it would fail because the tests are being run by root (as sometimes
      happens when installing Perl modules). 
                            --Jesse Vincent (jesse@bestpractical.com)

0.33 Tue 24 Oct 2006
    - Previous release tested ok.
    - Incrementing for production release.
    - No functional changes

0.32_01 Mon 23 Oct 2006
    - Use File::Spec to clean/canon paths instead of hand-stripping trailing slash
    - Apply the File::Path "safe" check manually for the root only, and
      use File::Path itself with safe OFF, so that we can handle deleting
      deep readonly files (and do it properly on VMS)
    - Added a test for the deletion of deep readonly files
    - Removing the use of "our" variables to try and get the Perl version
      dependency back to at least 5.005.
    - Report "deleted" for non-existant files they want to delete
    - Report the path they pass, but for dir USE a File::Spec->canonpath

    - Applied Eric Hanchrow's patch to support filenames with spaces.

0.20 Tue Apr 15 23:34:25 1998
    - Now you can pass a scalar reference as the first argument and it
      will used as the recursive flag when removing directories.  With
      recursive flag set to 0 only the files in the directory are
      removed and no attempt is made to recurse into subdirectories.
      Nevertheless, if the directory becomes empty it is removed.

0.12 Tue Apr 14 15:50:56 1998
    - change the umask and set the permission on directories so we can
      remove the files

0.11 Mon Apr 13 16:37:30 1998
    - changed the return values to successes rather than failures since
      it makes more sense.

0.10  Fri Apr 10 22:32:13 EDT 1998
    - original version
