    - Now you can pass a scalar reference as the first argument and it
      will used as the recursive flag when removing directories.  With
      recursive flag set to 0 only the files in the directory are
      removed and no attempt is made to recurse into subdirectories.
      Nevertheless, if the directory becomes empty it is removed.

    - change the umask and set the permission on directories so we can
      remove the files

0.11 Mon Apr 13 16:37:30 1998
    - changed the return values to successes rather than failures since
      it makes more sense.
